# Datathon UMD

I was a part of the team 'Dataholics' and am proud to say that we were one of the 6 finalists of the datathon.

## What was datathon 2024?
The 2024 UMD Datathon was organized in collaboration with Deloitte, with almost 400 students from UMD and American University's Kogod School of Business forming 53 teams. This competition was a platform for us to demonstrate our problem solving, analytics, data visualization, and presentation abilities as we vied to propose a city for a new NBA team, complete with a selected sponsor, mascot, and international partnership.

## Case

*“With the growing popularity of professional basketball, the National Basketball Association (NBA) is looking to expand their league from 30 teams to 32. There have been talks of these teams being placed in Seattle, WA and Las Vegas, NV. However, the NBA isn't sold on these being the best options and wants to explore other cities to maximize the profit, viewership, and international marketability for the NBA. Your team of consultants and data scientists have been hired to recommend how the NBA should proceed with this expansion”*

There were quite a few case questions we had to answer here are a few

### Case questions:

*We had to explore a lot of different questions for this competitions which includes* 

1. *What are the two cities that your team sees as the best options to place a new team in? How did your team come to this conclusion?*
2. *Choose one of the two locations you selected above. The NBA would like to understand estimated revenue and costs associated with this new location.*
3. *The NBA would like to preemptively create a promotional plan for the new team you selected above. This included propose a team mascot, team colors and why those colors?*
4. *Despite the NBA not being an inherently global brand, one executive wants to explore the possibility of growing a fanbase for the new team in an international market. Select a country you recommend they target and explain why this market could be a successful endeavor for the NBA.*
